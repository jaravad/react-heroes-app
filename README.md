# Heroes App

This is a Single Page Application built with React to display information about heroes. The application is using static data, and it was developed to practice some concepts such as:

- State management with useReducer.
- Exposing state to multiple components using React Context.
- Improving performance by using memoization.
- Nested routing and routes protection using React Router.
- Getting information from route params and query strings.
- Basic authentication workflow.

The app is live running at: https://react-heroes-app.surge.sh
